# Contributing Code

PXT accepts bug fix pull requests. For a bug fix PR to be accepted, it must first have a tracking issue that has been marked approved. Your PR should link to the bug you are fixing. If you've submitted a PR for a bug, please post a comment in the bug to avoid duplication of effort.

PXT also accepts new feature pull requests. For a feature-level PR to be accepted, it first needs to have design discussion. Design discussion can take one of two forms a) a feature request in the issue tracker that has been marked as approved or b) the PR must be accompanied by a full design spec and this spec is later approved in the open design discussion. Features are evaluated against their complexity, impact on other features, roadmap alignment, and maintainability.

These two blogs posts on contributing code to open source projects are a good reference: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and [Don't "Push" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik.
