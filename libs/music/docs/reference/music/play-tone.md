## Parameters

* ``frequency`` is the [number](/types/number) of [Hertz](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz) (how high or low the tone is, also known as _pitch_).
* ``ms`` is the [number](/types/number) of milliseconds (one-thousandth of a second) that the tone lasts for.

## Special handling of values

* If ``frequency`` is less or equal to zero, the sound is stopped.
* If ``ms`` is negative or zero, the sound is not stopped and will keep beeping.

## Example #example

Store the musical note 'C' in the variable `freq` and play that note for 1000 milliseconds (one second).

```blocks
let freq = music.noteFrequency(Note.C);
music.playTone(freq, 1000)
```
