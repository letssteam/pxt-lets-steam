The tone will keep playing until you stop it with [``||music:stop all sounds||``](/reference/music/stop-all-sounds).

## Parameters

* ``frequency`` is a [number](/types/number) that says
how high-pitched or low-pitched the tone is.  This
number is in **Hz** (**Hertz**), which is a measurement of frequency (_pitch_).

## Example #example

Play a tone with a base frequency of ``440`` but change it by ``20`` Hertz steps both up and down.

```blocks
let offset = 0
offset = -100
while (true) {
    while (offset < 100) {
        offset += 20
        music.ringTone(440 + offset)
        pause(300)
    }
    while (offset > -100) {
        offset += -20
        music.ringTone(440 + offset)
        pause(300)
    }
}
```
